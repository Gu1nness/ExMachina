## What is this useless script ?

This is the script written by Caleb Smith in the movie
[EX_MACHINA](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/)(2015)

During a coding scene, he writes it.

When executing it, it prints the following result : ```ISBN = 9780199226559```

This ISBN is the one of [this book](http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780199226559)

I found it a nice easter egg.
